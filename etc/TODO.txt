Code Refactor - Doing
  
  boss : 
    I feel like player and boss should be the same, just with different teams
    aka - make team export and based on that, make bullets instantiated damage the team
  projectiles : 
    make them all the same, just target different groups

make boss like in ETG, move when shooting and stopping as needed

add shot spread to mage ability 1

make other mage abilities

make character selection screen:
  needs more than 1 class, otherwise done

make ui not look shit

make game end when both players die or boss dies - partially done?

add win screen

make game actually spawn players and bosses

rename EVERYTHING that is dodge to ability 3 and ability 3 to ability 4
